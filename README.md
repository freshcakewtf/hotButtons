# Hot Buttons

We all love Hot Keys! I mean, who doesn't? Here is a UI panel for Adobe After Effects that simplifies the application of some of my most commonly used expressions with the click of a button.

## Features

The Hot Buttons UI panel provides quick access to several useful expressions:

- **Text with Box**: 
  - Creates a Text layer with a box that auto-scales around it.
  - Use the Margin slider on the generated null to adjust padding around the text.

- **Auto Center Anchor Point**: 
  - Automatically centers the anchor point on the selected layer for easier alignment.

- **Over Shoot**: 
  - Applies an overshoot bounce animation to selected keyframes.
  - Adjust the effect using the Freq (frequency) and Decay sliders on the generated null.

- **Wiggle Loop**: 
  - Creates a continuous wiggle effect.
  - Customize the effect with sliders for frequency, amplitude, and time on the generated null.

## Installation

1. Download the zip file from the repository.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a convenient location on your computer.
3. Move the scripts from the `script` folder into the After Effects Scripts directory:
   - **macOS**: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects 2024/Scripts/`
   - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects 2024\Support Files\Scripts\`
4. Move the `Hot Buttons.jsx` file into the ScriptUI Panels directory:
   - **macOS**: `/Applications/Adobe After Effects 2024/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/`
   - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects 2024\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels\`
5. Launch or restart Adobe After Effects.

## How to Use

1. Open Adobe After Effects.
2. Navigate to the `Window` menu and select `Hot Buttons` from the list of available ScriptUI Panels.
3. The Hot Buttons panel will appear. Click on any button to apply the corresponding expression or effect to your selected layer.

## Troubleshooting

- **Panel Not Appearing**: Ensure that the `Hot Buttons.jsx` file is placed in the correct directory and that After Effects is restarted.
- **Expression Not Applying**: Verify that the correct layer is selected before clicking the button.
